		<p>Hello! My name is Nathan Jennex and I'm a first year student here at Fanshawe. I moved to London from Toronto. So far I have found this class EXTREMLEY chalenging, but I am determined to get coding down. I plan to take the skills I have learned in this program and start my own business venture! Before you ask, no, I don’t know exactly  what a “business venture” entails, but I know that I would like to take a shot at some sort of independent/freelance work where I get to make the decisions.
